The sample displayed uses stainless steel rings made from .063inch (1.60mm / 16 SWG) wire wrapped on 5/16inch (7.94mm) mandrel. With a measured ID of .346inch (8.79mm) these rings bear an AR of 5.5. An AR of 2.9 is the minimum for E4-1. An AR of 3.0 is ideal for structural applications such as basketry. Inlays can be done in any AR possible with this weave, but are best done in the three to four range so they look less open. As a fabric, the maille maker will have to find a ring size that provides the desired openness and flexibility of the weave.
